Q1. Explain using code examples what is meant by props and state in React JS?

A1. In react props and state are variables that can contain any type of data, however,
props allow multiple types of data much like a python dictionary and can be returned to other react componenets to read from but cant modify,
a state on the other hand is used to handle internal data within a component and can be set using a useState.

// Sample code for props
const ParentComponent = () => {
  const data = 'Hello from Parent';
  return <ChildComponent message={data} />;
};
const ChildComponent = (props) => {
  return <p>{props.message}</p>;
};

// Sample code for state
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

const handleIncrement = () => {
setCount(count + 1);
};
<button onClick={handleIncrement}>Increment</button>
