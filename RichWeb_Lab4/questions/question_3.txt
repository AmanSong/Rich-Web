Q3. We have looked at three kinds of asynchronous programming mechanisms, namely callbacks, promises and streams. Mention one advantage and one disadvantage of each type.

A3.
Callbacks, is a technique that uses functions to call other functions, the advantage of this is that it is very simple to implment,
the disadvantage is that it can be very easy to get lost if you have many callbacks all calling functions everywhere.

Promises, a promise is when a function basically promises a return of to another function or code, the main advantage is that errors can be handled easier and
code can become much more readable, disadvantages are that once a promise has been initiated it cannot be stopped, this can be bad if you must stop the promise.
