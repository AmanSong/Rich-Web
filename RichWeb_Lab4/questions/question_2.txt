Q2. In functional programming, what does the term functor mean? Can you give an example in JavaScript?

A2. Functors are data types usually an array that implments a map function. This allows it to transform values within the data type
while maintaining structure of the data.

// Sample
const array = [1,2,3,4,5];

const doubled = array.map((number) => number * 2)

doubled contains [2,4,6,8,10];
