Q5. Detail how the browser loads and bootstraps a rich web application from an initial URL

A5.
Once a user inputs a URL, the browser then begins to convert the url into a IP address using DNS so it can identify the server hosting ther web app,
once the ip address is found, the browser iniates a http request to the server to retrieve the files such as html, css etc.
When the browser recieves the files from the server it then begins to parse and load the files,
any css found it will parse and render as well,
any javascript will also be executed or fetched.
After this then the web app can then be rendered on screen for the user to view.
Any additional resourves required will be fetched and rendered in the background.
